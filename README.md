# Project Title

Language and compiler independent framework for pointer analysis.
"""This framework specifically intakes predefined intermediate representation and converts it into its equvalent control flow graphs."""

## Getting Started

Check if your machine has Python3.
use """python3 --version"""

Otherwise check section Prerequsites.

Unzip the folder on your local machine and go to the same directory (unzipped folder).
use """cd foldername"""

Compile the system using the following command using default input file:
use """python3 Parser.py input.txt"""

### Prerequisites

Python3:

"""$ sudo apt-get install python3"""

## Running the tests

"""$ python3 Parser.py testcase.txt"""

Place testcase file in the same folder as your code/executable file.
Extension of that file should be ".txt".
